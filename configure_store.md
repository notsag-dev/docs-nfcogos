# Set up your store

Setting up your NFCogos store is very simple:

## Install NFCogos for businesses

Install the _NFCogos_ app available for Android and iOS. From this app you will manage your store information, such us changing your profile picture, adding products, and even track your plantation if you are a grower.

## Complete the onboarding process

After creating your account using your Google account, Apple ID, or with your credentials, you will be automatically asked to complete some information about your store as part of our onboarding process.

Among the steps of the onboarding process you will prompted to pick your physical store from Google Maps if you wish it to appear on our dispensary map: the [Cogomap](https://map.nfcogos.com).

## Verify your physical store

Your store will appear on the Cogomap automatically when selecting it during the onboarding process. However, it will have to be verified for you to have full control over it. Please email us at [contact@nfcogos.com](mailto:contact@nfcogos.com?subject=Account verification) to discuss its verification process.

## Add your products

Once your account has been verified your store will appear as a verified account on the Cogomap, and you will be able to add new products from the NFCogos app.

You can create them from the _My products_ section of the dashboard.

## You're all set!

And that's it. Users can now see your products on the Cogomap, and also announce a visit to it through our "Check in" feature so their friends and people nearby can see it and discover their opinion about your products!
